All can be sorted by Neighborhood.
In the arrest databaes, you can look up certain crimes commited. 2707 is the penal code of "Propulsion of missiles"...

We can create a story such as, "We first ranked the neighborhoods based on arrest data. Who had the most arrests? Then, we found the neighboorhoods with the most incidents
of penal code 2707: Propulsion of missiles. We have such concluded that the propulsion of missiles is the highest ranked crime and we should probably avoid the neighboorhood with 
the most incidents.

Once we found some potential non-missile friendly neighborhoods, we asked ourselves, 'If I were to buy a house, I probably don't want it to burn down.' So, we decided to look into 
the pittsburgh Fire Incidents database and plotted it with the data collected from the neighborhoods with the missile incidents. The neighborhoods with the highest rates of fire incidents
likely have some arsonists.

Once we have selected out a few neighborhoods, the main question arises: "Where am I to start a family?" You can't have kids without a playground. So, we examined the playground equipment
data set for which neighborhood has the most playground equipment."

or something. I'm not entirely sold on the last part, but I think the first two are sort of funny
